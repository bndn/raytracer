# Raytracer

> A semi-efficient raytracing back-end powered by caffeine and bad puns

This raytracer was written at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://itu.dk) as part of our second year project; software development in large team with international collaboration.

The raytracer enables tracing of both primitive objects, implicitly defined mathematical surfaces, and complex triangle meshes. Both flat and smooth shading are supported in addition to variable-depth reflection. Rendering is accelerated through use of SAH-based k-d trees and data parallelization.
